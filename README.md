# ĀTO

ĀTO v0.1.2 allows anyone to register both physical and digital artworks on Ethereum. The shares are then for sale and holders of these shares can win the NFT.

It deploys `Auction.sol`, `Shares.sol`, `NFT.sol`, and register these new instances in `Clerk.sol`.

A demo is available at [https://strat.cc/ato](https://strat.cc/ato).
